            <h3>What do I need to know before choosing equipment or tools?</h3>
            <p>
              Planning is crucial to any project â€” your timeline and budget
              depend on it. And choosing the right equipment can keep your
              project on track. Before you get started, you need to assess the
              job: What are the conditions and terrain of the site? What is the
              schedule? When you have answered those questions, you can narrow
              down the equipment specifications:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Height you need to reach</li>
              <li>Amount of earth you need to move</li>
              <li>2- or 4-wheel drive wheels, tracks, etc.</li>
              <li>Electric, gas/diesel or air power</li>
              <li>
                Any accessories you need such as pipe racks, tool trailers or
                bucket extensions
              </li>
