            <h5>Our Purpose Is To See, Create, and Package Value In A Way That Is Quickly Understandable, Deliverable and Profitable TM</h5>
            <p>Value is not determined by size, shape or condition. It is determined by TWO REAL BUYERS. Take away one of the two REAL BUYERS and the value is gone. People will buy just about anything if the price is right. That's not value, but yet that is exactly what happens at public auctions every day. We are artists in fairness and technicians in discovering and creating value in a way that is deliverable & profitable. For example, we utilize our synergy and buying power to get real buyers shipping discounts up to 80% and with no loading fees which creates a larger marketing territory.</p>
            <p>Isaiah 28 says: "If you error in vision you will stumble in judgment". Vision is what success looks like to the runners, the support team, and the spectators. We find our success in:</p>

            <h5>Our Vision is Enabling Our Clients To Stay Focused On Their Future By Becoming A Reliable Source To Manage, Remarket, or Purchase Used & Surplus Assets.</h5>
            <p>We do not put our success or that of our clients into the hands of someone else or other variables such as weather, bad timing, a late plane, or two buyers getting together on the side, all of which can prevent a success sale.</p>
            <p>We manage the process in a business- like fashion over the five 10 day periods described above. Over the past 35 years we have developed a global network of real buyers that know we move quickly and the opportunity will not last. It is not unusual for us to have 100 or more real buyers looking at an item we are selling. True value is simply a by-product.</p>
            <p>All of this coupled with one of the most powerful IBM database programs in the world enables us to turn the managing of surplus assets into a real time distribution or sales channel. 100 years ago every house had a water cistern. Today nobody has a cistern. Why? Because we have created reliable distribution channels for water that comes to our homes in such a reliable way that we just turn on and off the water with out a second thought.</p>
            <p>We at King Surplus are creating that same distribution channel for surplus assets. With warehouses across the USA and Mexico we can help our clients flow that asset directly into a system uniquely designed for them in real time.</p>
            <hr />
            <h5>Every Business Has Surplus Assets</h5>
            <p>Every business has surplus assets and could use a quality pre-owned asset in place of a new unit. In essence every business could use our service, whether as a client or a customer. Who we are, our experience, our relationships and systems integrate so wonderfully with our clients, and most consider us as important as their second tier vendor / manufacturing relationships.</p>

            <h5>Costs Are Going Up and Value Is Going Down</h5>
            <p>Ask a car dealer about what his costs are for keeping a used car on the lot. He will say, "Inventory financing, cleaning, gas, sales time, insurance, overhead, sales lot expenses, opportunity cost, etc, etc, etc. They mount up daily. Then ask him what the new "blue book" is going to say about its value. He will say, "Every week it goes down in value. The same thing is happening to your surplus.</p>
            <p>Call us for new and innovative ways to maximize quickly your capital recovery from surplus assets. Remember, every day you wait, its cost goes up and the value goes down. Call today!</p>
            <p>Thanks again for your interest in our company.</p>
